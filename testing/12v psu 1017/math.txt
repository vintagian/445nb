Testing plan:
voltage read: 12.31 +- 0.1V

simulating 1A, 3A, and 5.5A load

12/1A = 12ohms 12W to dissipate
12/3A = 4ohms 36 W to dissipate
12/5.5A = 2.182 ohms 66W to dissipate

Using 7 cement resistors 15 ohms 20W in parallel 15/7 = 2.14: 12/2.14 = V^2/r = 144/15 = 9.6W sunk thus safe to use for testing

7 resistors in parallel 12/2.14 = 5.6A

4 resistors in parallel: 3.75ohms->12/3,75ohms = 3.2A tested for 3A

2 resistor in parallel: 7.5 ohms -> 12/7.5 1.6A testing for 1A
